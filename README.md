Median Rental Pricings in Manhattn NYC, Pre and Post COVID-19
In this notebook I analyze the rental pricing pre and Post COVID-19 for most expensive city and borough in the world such as Manhattan in New York.

This notebook will attempt to answer: What is the most expensind neighborhoods to rent Manhattan,y, if any, while also examining if the COVID-19 period has affected the rental price? The notebook will utilize NYC rental data available on StreetEasy to attempt to answer the questions mentioned.

Some of the parameters set for this project include looking at data from the lfive six yefrom rs (January2018 December2022)

areaName is the name of the neighborhood, areaType is the setting oneighborhoodorhood, Borough is the New York county the neighborhood rewhile we have five Borough: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, staten Island for this project we analyse only Manhattan. s, and as mentioned, Price is the median rental price for that neighboations.
To explore the distribution of median rental pricing for each neighborhood, I used a violin plot, boxplot and histogram. From the first chart, we can see thatit is not normal distributed. One of main reason of big difference betweeen avarage rental prices is top neigborhood,those grafs we see below. We see standart deviation is 417As we know standart deviation is the avreage amount of variability in your dataset. It tells you, on average,how far each value lies from the mean. . 417$ standard deviation means that values are generally far from the mean.

If we analyse how prices changed during covide and after covid we see prices decrease durinc covid-19 for all neighborhood except top two neighborhood.From 2021 prices increased dramaticly for all neighborhood except last two neighborhood

An analysis of rental price trends reveals a notable decrease across most neighborhoods during the COVID-19 period. However, the top two neighborhoods experienced relatively stable prices. Subsequently, from 2021 onwards, there was a significant uptick in prices across all neighborhoods, except for the last two neighborhoods.
