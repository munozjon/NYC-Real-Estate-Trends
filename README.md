Do interest rates have an impact on the commercial real estate market? 

Based on the data I obtained through open data resources in NYC. I was able to better understand the effect of Federal Reserve policy on the commercial real estate sector. Federal Reserve policy leading up to the beginning of COVID (March 2020), during COVID and the effects on our current economy by monetary policy. 

Sales Volume: 
The lead up to the start of Covid showed weakness beginning to form in the commercial real estate sector. Sales volume decreased by 66% and bottomed out in 2020. The decrease in sales volume was a result of tighter monetary conditions from the Federal Reserve which raised interest rates and discontinued quantitative easing. The increase in total sales volume going into 2021 was a result of Federal Reserve policy u-turn during the drop in equity markets.The sales volume increase by 200% in that short period of time.The lowering of interest rates and purchases of CMBS lead to increased property sales for NYC commercial real estate. 

Median Sales Price: 
The median sales price for all commercial buildings prior to 2020 was trending lower and bottomed out in 2020. The year of 2021 saw a sharp rise in the median sales price for the commercial real estate market.This was a result of many large commercial office buildings being sold during that time.The rise in the real estate during 2021 was a result of the lowering of the Fed Funds Rate and quantitative easing. The median sales price will continue to trend lower in the coming years from tighter monetary conditions and work environment transformations.
